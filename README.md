Action Over Words: Project 1

Melissa Garcia

<strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
This website is a starting base for a strength and conditioning platform with available programs for professional athletes to the every day athlete. The idea is to take a holistic approach through training, nutrition and recovery. My goal for this site is promote my training programs quicker and make them more accessible to my clients.

<strong><u>How to Use</u></strong>
You can navigate through the site from the navigation bar on top. The Training and Recovery pages are populated with card decks that will eventually have sample programs attached.  

<strong><u> Technologies Used</u></strong>
I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for this project so far.

<strong><u>Proposed Progessions</u></strong>
The next progression of the site would be to attach/upload all the programs to the Stronger, Faster, Conditioning, Athlete, and Mobility programs. My idea is to have a sample attached. Then if they are interested they can purchase 1-3 month programs through the site. Once I get my Precision Nutrition Certification I can add more to the Nutrition page in regards to nutrition coaching and plans. Another addition would be testimonials and possibly roll out soccer training programs as well.

<strong><u>USER STORIES</u></strong>
As an professional athlete, I can need a simple mobility program for while I'm in season.

As a youth athlete, I need access to affordable training programs.

As a stay at home mom, I need a personalized nutrition program to follow for my body and goals.
